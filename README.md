With Remote-CMD, you can establish a Terminal session to a computer from another computer that's connected to the same network or to the Internet.

## Usage
On host, run **server.py**

```bash
python3 server.py
```

For Client, use **client.py** (For security reasons, no more than one client can be connected to a remote)

```bash
python3 client.py <IPv4 Address of the server> <client preferred name>

```
